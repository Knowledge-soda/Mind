Mind
=====
Mind is divided on three parts (for now): Mind.Knowledge, Mind.Orientation, Mind.Imagination and Mind.Existence (and Mind.Test but it's only for testing).
Next version will be 0.3.1

In that version Existence will be improved.

For help see Documentation, Tutorial, use Mind.Tets file (and try to understand its code) and see pro_1.py and pro_2.py files (on GitHub).

Note: documentation might be late on PyPI so check one on GitHub.
