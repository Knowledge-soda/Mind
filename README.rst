Mind
=====
Mind is divided on four parts (for now): Mind.Knowledge, Mind.Orientation, Mind.Imagination and Mind.Existence.

Next version will be 0.3.3

In that version I'm completely rewriting Knowledge.

For help see Documentation, Tutorial, see pro files (and try to understand its code).

Notes: Documentation on PYPI might be late, Mind is Python 2 incompatible!
